- **MediaRecorder API** - To capture your haunted moments
- **Web Components** - Custom elements from the shadow DOM

## 🦇 How the Curse Works

1. The camera awakens and seeks your face
2. A jack-o'-lantern materializes over your visage
3. As you open your mouth, the pumpkin's grin stretches with yours
4. Your movements are tracked in real-time at 30 FPS
5. Capture photos or videos with the pumpkin permanently haunting them

## 🕸️ Technical Sorcery

The pumpkin filter uses advanced face detection to:

- Track 468 facial landmarks in real-time
- Calculate mouth opening ratio (normalized from 0 to 1)
- Apply dynamic vertical scaling to the jack-o'-lantern
- Maintain aspect ratio across all devices
- Survive in both photos and recorded videos

## 💀 Requirements

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Camera permissions (the spirits demand it)
- A brave soul willing to face the pumpkin curse

## 🎃 Usage

Simply open `index.html` in your browser and allow camera access. The jack-o'-lantern will find you...

Toggle the haunted switch on the right side of your screen to control the pumpkin's presence. But beware - once you've seen it, you can never truly unsee it.
